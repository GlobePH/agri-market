# Agri-Market

### About:
Agri-Market is an online platform providing software as a service with tolls and services for web and mobile.

We are an avenue that allows direct communication between agricultural suppliers and consumers in order to solve fair price of products. 

Agrimarket is a platform for buyer and seller to get better market price and create a competitive market without sacrificing quality or income. We give suppliers more freedom in choosing markets and wider variety for buyers to choose their products. Agrimarket supports direct selling therefore increasing farmer's income, and reducing consumers’ food costs.

For the consumer, it gives a map-based view of available suppliers and their products in the Philippines, access to the contact number of suppliers and wide variety of products available for buying. 

For the supplier, it would help them get in touch with the consumer, sell their product and price it right, view the current prices of similar products, and check products on demand. 

Suppliers and consumers registered on Agri-Market get instant notification on their mobile via SMS and Facebook for updates on new products and product review. Agri-Market is also connected on Google Maps and suppliers and consumers can easily be traced on the map and see trends on product offerings and demands with the help of geographic location.
